# HouseholdHarmonizer
Application listens to your family and alerts household members to potential misunderstandings (hopefully before they result in fights). Works with a Smart Speaker &amp; iOS or Android device.

Note - it is possible that this concept will be too creepy for people not wanting Alexa interjecting (it?)self into their personal lives.  However this same principle could be used for:

- Mediators to get feedback on their use of open-ended questions and other mediator tools
- Lawyers to get feedback on their success avoiding surprises when questioning witnesses
- Anyone interested in analyzing conversation for misunderstandings / missed meaning
